Kobuki Distributors
===================

A place to collect location information about kobuki/turtlebot distributors. 

If it's a turtlebot distributor, be sure to mark them on the [turtlebot map](https://github.com/turtlebot/map) as well.

geojson.io is a good place for editing, but interaction with github is still awkward. You can do like below, but I find it far easier just to make pull requests from direct edits.

Try this link to edit: http://geojson.io/#id=github:yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/blob/master/Distributors.geojson

To embed use this snippet: 
```<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/master/Distributors.geojson"></script>```
