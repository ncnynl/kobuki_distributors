Kobuki Distributors
===================

A place to collect location information about Kobuki (& TurtleBot 2) distributors. The information here is shown on the distributor map on the [Kobuki website](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com/home-en/store/).

Required Information
--------------------

If it's a new distributor,

* Name
* Web URL
* Latitude/Longitude (use google maps)

Other Updates
-------------

If it's a TurtleBot 2 distributor, be sure to mark them on the [turtlebot map](https://github.com/turtlebot/map) as well.

How to Update
-------------

I find it easiest just to make pull requests from [direct edits](https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/edit/master/Distributors.geojson).

For pretty editing -> [use this link](http://geojson.io/#id=github:yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/blob/master/Distributors.geojson). The GitHub interaction seems rather awkward though. 



Embedding the Map in a Web Page
