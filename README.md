Kobuki Distributors
===================

A place to collect location information about kobuki/turtlebot distributors. 

Required Information
--------------------

If it's a new distributor,

* Name
* Web URL
* Latitude/Longitude (use google maps)

Other Updates
-------------

If it's a turtlebot distributor, be sure to mark them on the [turtlebot map](https://github.com/turtlebot/map) as well.

How to Update
-------------

I find it easiest just to make pull requests from [direct edits](https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/edit/master/Distributors.geojson).

For pretty editing -> [use this link](http://geojson.io/#id=github:yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/blob/master/Distributors.geojson). The github interaction seems rather awkward though. 



Embedding the Map in a Web Page
