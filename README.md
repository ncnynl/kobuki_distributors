Kobuki Distributors
===================

A place to collect location information about kobuki/turtlebot distributors. 

Required Information
--------------------

If it's a new distributor,

* Name
* Web URL
* Latitude/Longitude (use google maps)

Other Updates
-------------

If it's a turtlebot distributor, be sure to mark them on the [turtlebot map](https://github.com/turtlebot/map) as well.

How to Update
-------------

geojson.io is a good place for editing, but interaction with github is still awkward. You can do like below, but I find it far easier just to make pull requests from [direct edits](https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/edit/master/Distributors.geojson).

For the pretty, but awkward geojson editing -> [use this link](http://geojson.io/#id=github:yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/blob/master/Distributors.geojson)

Embedding the Map in a Web Page
-------------------------------

Use this snippet:

```
<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/yujinrobot/kobuki_distributors/master/Distributors.geojson"></script>
```
